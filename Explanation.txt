Given a binary tree, return the tilt of the whole tree.
The tilt of a tree node is defined as the absolute difference between the sum of all left subtree node values and the sum of all right subtree node values. Null node has tilt 0.
The tilt of the whole tree is defined as the sum of all nodes' tilt.

Input Description:
First line contains, n the size of binary tree values.(2<n<1000)
Second line contains, binary tree values.

Output Description:
Print the tilt of whole tree.

Sample Input:
3
1 2 3

Sample Output:
1

Explanation:
The given tree,
         1
       /   \
      2     3
Tilt of node 2 : 0
Tilt of node 3 : 0
Tilt of node 1 : |2-3| = 1
Tilt of binary tree : 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
